- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clickItDBriner
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how to optimize and automate media processes using IT.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a whole lot â€“ from devops to FE coding. Lately have been dabbling in Angular, python and IOT for a Tetris project, looking to get my hands more dirty with Kotlin.

ðŸ“« How to reach me   
Feel free to PM me on GitHub :smile:
